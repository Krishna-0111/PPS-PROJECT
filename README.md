# Food Bank Donation & Distribution Management System...

This project is developed in C language as part of our PPS coursework.  

It is designed to help manage food donations and distributions for a food bank.

The system ensures that donated food items are recorded properly, requests from families are handled fairly, and food is distributed efficiently based on FIFO (First-In-First-Out) and priority rules.  

Our goal is to minimize food waste and maximize fair distribution to those in need.


##  Features...

- Record donations (item type, quantity, expiry date, donor name)
  
- Record recipient requests (family size, dietary restrictions, priority level)
  
- Distribute food using FIFO and priority-based allocation
  
- Generate daily reports (distribution summary, waste due to expiry, donor acknowledgements)
